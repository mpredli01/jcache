This example application demonstrates how to use [JCache](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107) and is adapted from the [Baeldung JCache article](http://www.baeldung.com/jcache). The application uses a JSON parser to read and parse the data in `publications.json`. 

The application can be built and run with [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) or [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) by executing the commands:

`mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.redlich.jcache.Application"`

`gradle clean build run`
